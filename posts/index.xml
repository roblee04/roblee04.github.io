      <description>smarter Theres only two kinds of &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; students:&#xA;One. The ones that are intrinsically motivated (they love the subject)&#xA;Two. The ones that who&amp;rsquo;s lives depend on their academics (fighting to survive)&#xA;My last year has been me being a mixture of the two.&#xA;I find that I really enjoy parts of computer science.</description>

      <description>Motivation and Inspiration mimi and leo, my two cats. I love them. Modern search engines aren&amp;rsquo;t very good at finding pictures (only via metadata) i think vision models are pretty cool Whats the basic idea? Have an API to do the search!&#xA;provided by the image server files live on the image server actually, the image server does all the computation The API is then called by a some static site.</description>

      <description>Welcome! I was having some fun browsing /r/localLLaMA and I saw that llama3 popped up!&#xA;At the time it was real good for its parameter size and just in general, so I wanted to try to run it!&#xA;Of course, I could&amp;rsquo;ve ran it in a Q5 quantized form on my desktop with a 1080ti, however, I felt like using my school funding to use.</description>

      <description>Right now, I’m a 4th year computer science and engineering student at SCU.&#xA;I’ve taken many foundational and theoretical/technical courses that had a good amount of difficulty to them. Out of all my courses at SCU, these were probably the most challenging:&#xA;Machine Learning + Data Mining – COEN140 – David Anastasiu Compilers – Coen175 – Darren Atkinson Digital Logic Design – ELEN 160 – Mamudur Rahman</description>

      <description>LupinStory I tried to recreate a funny little Maplestory game that I played as a little kid.&#xA;It was called MonkeyStory.&#xA;Maplestory was a big part of my childhood, I played a ton of it with my brother and I remember revolving a lot a lot of time around it.</description>

      <description>Advice to my previous self and other interesting SCU Things At the time of this writing, I am freshly graduated with my bachelors from Santa Clara University. \&#xA;Physically, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel any different than I did four years ago. Mentally, I feel like I already experienced a lifetime. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of how aging works.</description>
