## LupinStory - A MapleStory Tribute

A nostalgic recreation of a MapleStory-inspired flash game I played as a kid.

### Background

MapleStory was a big part of my childhood. I played tons of it with my brother and have many fond memories of both official servers and private servers like RydahMS.

### Features

- Classic 2D side-scrolling gameplay
- Nostalgic MapleStory-style graphics
- Simple combat and movement mechanics

### Technical Implementation

- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript game engine
- Sprite-based animation system

### Try It Out!

The game is still very much a work in progress, but you can try it here:

### Memories

Some of my favorite MapleStory memories:
- Private servers with rebirths and max stat items
- Farming pigs for leather to make work gloves
- Demon Slayer's vacuum skill
- Hanging out in the Cash Shop
