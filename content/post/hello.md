## Who am I?

In case you wanted to learn more about me I guess this is where you can find me.

As you have read in the About Me page, I have an interest in a wide variety of subjects which include math, philosophy, branches of computer science, and literature.

Currently, some things that I want to dive into are:

### Cellular Automata

The most famous example being Conway's Game of Life.

Basically, given some simple rules or logic, complex or emergent behavior can occur.

In the Game of Life, this can occur as gliders, oscillators, and glider guns.

But the big thing is that emergent and complex behavior can be formed based on just on simple constraints and logic. In the most recent example, ChatGPT and applications of similar large language models can do basic reasoning, arithmetic, and problem solving tasks given that LLMs are just neural networks (pattern recognition machines from how I say it). I am really curious to emergent behavior comes to be in other flavors of science and life in general (brain, biochem, etc).

### Intermediate Forms of Data

Intermediate forms mainly talk about how something is represented in a versatile form.

For example, say that you wanted to greet someone. How can you do that? In English you could say:
- hey
- hello
- what's up
- sup dawg

And the list goes on. But, what if you wanted to greet anyone regardless of language? There ain't no way you're going to be learning 10+ language greetings. Why not just wave hello? That seems pretty easy. And to me, that is a form of intermediate representation.

The avenues of Intermediate Representations / Intermediate Forms I am currently interested in are as follows:

**Compilers**: High level --> ISA / Assembly --> low level LLVM IR

**NLP / ML application**: Image --> Tensor, Words --> Tensor

What is especially cool about word tensors as I briefly mentioned above is the equation below that a computer could compute!

King – Man + Woman = Queen

### Beauty of Math

Mandelbrot Set, fibonacci pyramid.

Randomness leading to Order.

### How to be Good in an Unjust World

What are you motivated by?

Spirituality without structured religion. Do you believe in Life after Death?
