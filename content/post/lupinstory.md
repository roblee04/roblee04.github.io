## LupinStory

I tried to recreate a funny little Maplestory game that I played as a little kid.

It was called MonkeyStory.

Maplestory was a big part of my childhood, I played a ton of it with my brother and I remember revolving a lot of time around it.

Some things I remember:

**RydahMS / MS private servers:**
- rebirths
- max stat items
- voting for NX
- cheesing Ergoth with heal

**GMS:**
- farming pigs for leather to make work gloves to sell for 1M mesos a pop
- Demon Slayer vacuum skill on scarecrows
- mechanic
- bing chilling in the Cash Shop and trying on a bunch of cool stuff

I wanted to pay homage to it by recreating a tiny flash game version of it.

It is very very WIP, but you can try it here!
