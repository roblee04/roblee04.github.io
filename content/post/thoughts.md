## Smarter

There's only two kinds of "smart" students:

One. The ones that are intrinsically motivated (they love the subject)

Two. The ones that who's lives depend on their academics (fighting to survive)

My last year has been me being a mixture of the two.

I find that I really enjoy parts of computer science. Both in the nitty gritty details of programming languages and compilers and in high level design of distributed systems and virtualization. My projects that I displayed are some of my most fondest of projects.

On the caveat, I have been trying to survive. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I convinced myself that I have to get a high paying job in order to support my family.

Surviving is hard you know…

Constant heart palpitations from stress. Waking up and my heart is already beating…

I also have had some memory issues. Like for real short term memory loss.

My intuition is that I had been taking in too much information. As a result the least recently used (wow LRU!) information is booted out.

Though I have high short term gains, this is not the way to live.

Food is an art form.

I loved Marlena's summer camp (it's a food place).

I loved Providence (in LA).

I always compare this kind of food to my favorite goldfish flavor: Flavor-blasting. Because that's exactly what it is. Often in good food, there is a complexity in flavor. Flavors A, B, and C could all be dishes themselves, but what if you put them all together?

I love food.

You gotta try it.

## Keeping Connected

My friendships with people don't go away easily.

I don't text my friends usually. I spend time with them online or in person.

My reaching out skills are really sucky though.

I find that when I am on a break. I turn to a sack of potatoes and just couldn't be bothered to go out.

It's not that I don't want to see my friends, it is that the embrace of home is too nice.

Like a warm bed on a cold day.

When we do see each other though, we pop off and it's like we've been talking since yesterday.

I love and appreciate my friends, but maybe this strategy ain't it when I grow up.
